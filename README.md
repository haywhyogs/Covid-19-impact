Analysis of impact of Covid-19 Pandemic on the employment professions in some areas of the United Kingdom.                                                                                                                
It was known that in the year 2020, Covid-19 pandemic disrupted the labour market, offices became closed and people were forced to work from their various homes while millions of people lost their jobs. 

There has been interest in looking at how this has affected the flows between employment, unemployment, and inactivity, in different professions, as well as the extent to which there has been any effect on labour market mismatch on those who have remained in employment. 

Also, previous report from office for National statistics shown that out of those employed in Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) and Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2020, 6.1% changed occupation in the first half of this year compared with 5.7% in the same period last year. Analysis of only those who have changed occupation in the first half of this year shows that associate professional and technical occupations experienced the greatest percentage of occupational outflows (20.9%) and occupational inflows (21.2%); over half (52.5%) also changed major industry. 

This project will focus on movements between occupations of those in employment that occurred in the labour market in the period covering the initial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and post lock - down. These figures will be compared with the years pre Covid-19 pandemic. Attention will be given specifically to occupational inflows and outflows of those who have remained in employment in the pandemic.
